Steps I've done to puppet-sandbox
(following https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k/blob/master/doc/dynamic-environments/quickstart.mkd)
gem install r10k
create /etc/r10k.yaml 
# The location to use for storing cached Git repos
:cachedir: '/var/cache/r10k'

# A list of git repositories to create
:sources:
  # This will clone the git repository and instantiate an environment per
  # branch in /etc/puppet/environments
  :my-org:
    remote: 'git@github.com:$_Insert GitHub Organization Here_$/$_Insert GitHub Repository That Will Be Used For Your Puppet Code Here_$'
    basedir: '/etc/puppet/environments'



Added jenkins to Vagrantfile and updated hosts.erb
pulled down the module for rtyler-jenkins... I'll need to manage that with r10k or puppet-lib
